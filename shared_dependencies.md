Shared Dependencies:

1. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - `tailwind.css`: The Tailwind CSS file will be included in the `<head>` section of each HTML file to ensure consistent styling across all pages.

2. **JavaScript Functions**:
   - `initializeProjects()`: A function in `main.js` that could be used to initialize project information on the homepage.
   - `toggleDarkMode()`: A function in `main.js` for toggling dark mode if implemented.

3. **DOM Element IDs**:
   - `#navbar`: The navigation bar element ID, which might be present on each page for consistent navigation.
   - `#project-container`: The ID for the container where project information will be dynamically loaded on the homepage.
   - `#footer`: The footer element ID, which might be present on each page for consistent information.

4. **Image Files**:
   - `img/profile.png`: The profile image that might be used on the homepage and possibly on project pages.
   - `favicon.ico`: The website's favicon, referenced in the `<head>` section of each HTML file.

5. **Project Page Specific**:
   - `projects/project1/index.html`, `projects/project2/index.html`, `projects/project3/index.html`: Each project page will share a similar structure and styling, possibly using the same CSS classes from Tailwind and custom styles if any.
   - `projects/project1/img/screenshot.png`, `projects/project2/img/screenshot.png`, `projects/project3/img/screenshot.png`: Screenshots for each project, which will be displayed on the respective project pages and possibly on the homepage.

6. **CSS Classes** (from Tailwind CSS):
   - `.container`: For main content areas.
   - `.dark-mode`: If a dark mode class is created for toggling themes.
   - `.project-card`: For styling individual project showcase cards.

7. **Data Schema**:
   - `Project`: A potential object structure to represent projects, which might include fields like `title`, `description`, `image`, and `url`.

8. **HTML Template Components**:
   - `header.html`: A shared header component that could be included in each HTML file.
   - `footer.html`: A shared footer component that could be included in each HTML file.

9. **Meta Tags**:
   - `<title>`: The title tag might be consistent with the format, e.g., "Name - AO Developer Portfolio".
   - `<meta>`: Description, viewport, and other meta tags will be consistent across all HTML files.
